# Final-year-project-Biomedical-Signal-Analysis

ML/DL based biomedical signal analysis and processing for disease identification and related hardware implementation.

Current Status:
1. Going through the NPTEL lectures in Machine Learning.
2. Exploring the disease dataset(available on Kaggle) and perform ML techniques on that(for learning phase).
3. Set up the hardware system and implement those techniques on some hardware(Raspberry Pi preferrable).

Future Updates:
1. Take the actual datasets from a hospital and build a ML model on top of it.
2. Implement the model on software and hardware both(try working on hardware parallely.
3. Try to optimize the model and perform Signal Analysis too, once the model works.
